    "To use the autograder, import the `mcautograder` package and make sure to your [tests file](#tests) with your notebook. When you load the notebook dependencies, import the file and initialize the grader by creating an instance of the `Notebook` class (the argument to pass is the path to your tests file):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mcautograder\n",
    "grader = mcautograder.Notebook(\"tests.py\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the autograder to score the questions, make sure to set `scored=True` in your `Notebook` call. **The default behavior of the autograder is to allow students to submit answers until they get the correct one.** If you want to change this behavior, you must set the `max_attempts` argument to an integer, the maximum number of retakes allowed. If this is the case, when students hit that ceiling, the check cells will throw an `AssertionError` because they've hit the retake ceiling.\n",

    "An example call for a scored notebook with a retake ceiling of 5 is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grader = Notebook(\"tests.py\", scored=True, max_attempts=5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the autograder to check answers, have students assign their answers to variables in the notebook; these answers can strings of length 1 or single-digit integers. Then call the `Notebook.check()` function; the first argument should be the question identifier in your tests file and the second should be the variable the student created.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_answer = \"A\"\n",
    "grader.check(\"q1\", my_answer)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the student's response matches the test file, then `Correct.` will be printed; otherwise, `Try again.` will be printed. If the student enters an invalid response (e.g. `float`, answer of > 1 character, hit retake ceiling), the grader will throw an `AssertionError` with a descriptive message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the score on a scored autograder, simply call `Notebook.score()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grader.score()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will contain the fraction of earned points out of possible points and the percentage.\n",
