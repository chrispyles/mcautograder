    "The autograder relies on a tests file to get the answers for the questions. Tests are ususally distributed in a hidden file, e.g. `.tests.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the file, define a variable `answers` which is a list containing dictionaries, each of which represents a single question. Each dictionary should contain 3 keys: `\"identifier\"`, `\"answer\"`, and, optionally, `\"points\"`. If your assignment is unscored, you can leave off the `\"points\"` key. A description of the keys' values is given below:\n",

    "| Key | Value Type | Value Description |\n",
    "|-----|-----|-----|\n",
    "| `\"identifier\"` | `str` | a unique question identifier |\n",
    "| `\"answer\"` | `str`, `int` | the answer to the question; specifications below |\n",
    "| `\"points\"` | `int` | optional; the number of points assigned to that question |\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers **must** be of length 1 (i.e. a single-character string or a single-digit integer). The autograder is currently set up to throw an `AssertionError` if an answer of length > 1 is submitted, although we do intend to add this functionality later.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a tests file is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "answers = [\n",
    "\t{\n",
    "\t\t\"identifier\": \"q1\",\n",
    "\t\t\"answer\": 3,\n",
    "\t\t\"points\": 1,\n",

    "The identifiers have no set format. This is because the identifier is passed to `Notebook.check()` when you call it in the notebook."
